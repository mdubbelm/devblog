## Cultural

Last week I saw a documentary/biopic/musical about one of my favourite bands ever: Pavement. The songs from the early nineties are on repeat again on my internal iPod.

## Work

I've recently fully embraced AI. Yes, I'm over to the dark side. But I'm experiencing so much fun in creating stuff: my own WordPress plugin to create this static website, and being able to deploy, do version control and publish it to the web has been a life changing learning experience. What's next? I actually have so many ideas, it's too hard to prioritize. All fun projects though. So should it be under work? Currently, I'm working on a personal progressive web app to learn Swedish.

## Travel

This spring, we bought a Volkswagen camper van. We've had so many great trips around Europe already. Looking forward to what's to come.

## Garden

We finally finished replacing the last wall of our summer house. We first wanted to grind and repaint, but a lot of the wood was in such a bad state, that renewing was a better choice. It now has a fresh first layer of blue paint. So on to the next project!

## Reading

No news here, but this year, again, I'm behind on my reading goal. Currently, I'm reading Normal People by Sally Rooney, which I really enjoy. In case you're interested in the full picture of what I have been reading, you can [check out my Storygraph account](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/modub).

## Photography

I recently took a course on photography. Just for fun, to have a reason to play with my camera. I actually learned some new things, so that was fun. Now of course I want a new camera, because I have a weakness for gadgets. I will explore the second hand market on DSLR's. Suggestions are more than welcome!

## Health

Things have not been great on the post COVID front. Also, my back has been in a bad state for more than 9 months. After a frustrating period of 8 months of visiting 2 physiotherapists, an X-ray of my hip and back, I eventually managed to fix my back myself by using an app with exercises that I did on a daily basis. I'm happy the pain is gone!
