## Cultural

In November, again we attended IDFA, the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam. Although the screenings were not as appealing to us as previous years, we saw some great documentaries. Again one by Nicolas Philibert about Radio France. And Whisper in the Woods, an nature documentary telling the story of three generations of nature lovers in the French Vosgues. Loads of eye candy!

## Work/hobby?

Developing with AI is addicting. I now feel so empowered. It still feels slightly filthy at the same time, using this unethical and environmental unfriendly technology. 
Latest update is, that I totally abandoned WordPress and now have my blog in MarkDown, writing in Obsidian. I use Claude code to write updates about my development projects and keep track of hours.
As for paid work: nothing new happening there. I'm thinking about applying for a product owner role. But not this year, I want to slip into Christmas coma soon.

## Travel

We're making plans to spend our next holiday in Scotland. And in January, we're visiting Paris by train for a weekend trip.

## Garden

I've not been there in a while. Weather has not been good, and now that days are shorter, we cannot go there on weekdays before it gets too dark. Also, a mild flu/cold has limited enthusiasm.

## Reading

I just read Oroppa, which was a great book but not very cheerful. In case you're interested in the full picture of what I have been reading, you can [check out my Storygraph account](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/modub).
