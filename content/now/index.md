## Cultural

I've been to some amazing and mindblowing movies, like Bugonia and the other day, the Last Viking. I am a great fan of both directors Yorgos Lanthimos and Anders Thomas Jensen. Also, Mads Mikkelsen who was one of the main characters in the Last Viking, is a great actor and always a joy to see him play. 

## Personal
It's been nearly a year since my mom had her kidney transplant. It's been going so well, we cannot imagine how it has been before. Also, Jacob's daughter who now lives in Sweden is visiting Amsterdam for Christmas. We saw them the end of October for the last time, so it's great to spend some time with them.

## Work

I've had some busy but fun weeks and I now feel comfortable to take it easy over the next 2 weeks, slowly clearing my head for next year. I do work but only half days, taking some time to learn and figure out stuff I don't have time for normally.

## Garden

I cut some twigs and want to make some X-mas decorations out of it. Better hurry because only 5 more days to go before it's the 25th!

## Reading

Now digging through a Dutch book about the Colonies of Benevolence that were founded in the 19th Century. An Amsterdam author researchers her family history and their poverty. I knew about it, but not with great detail. Apparently, [the site of the former colonies is now UNESCO cultural heritage](https://www.kolonienvanweldadigheid.eu/).  In case you're interested in the full picture of what I have been reading, you can [check out my Storygraph account](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/modub).
